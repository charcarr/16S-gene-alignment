# 16S-gene-alignment
A pipeline for bacterial species identification and quality control. <br/>
The scripts in this pipeline are designed to automate species identification through comparing 16S sangar sequences to a known bank of full length 16S gene sequences. 


<br/>


## Getting Started:


* Put the folder of sangar sequences in the `data/sangar_seqs` directory 
* Add the `what_are_our_strains.csv` to the `data` directory 



**Usage Instructions**

Open the `run_me.Rmd` file and follow the directions inside. <br/>
Each script can be run independently from within the document. 

Dependencies are listed below.

*R*

* tidyverse
* reticulate

*Python*

* requests
* beautifulsoupt4
